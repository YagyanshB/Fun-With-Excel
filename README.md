Over the course of the **YouTube Tutorial** you will be able to develop a robust understanding of the different functions being used in **Microsoft Excel.** These range from:

1. VLOOKUP
2. COUNTIFS
3. PIVOT CHARTS
4. PIVOT TABLES
5. DATA ANALYSIS BASICS

I would strongly recommend people who want to have a clear understanding of Excel to follow the tutorial and use the projects created for guidance when stuck. Lovely course indeed!
